  rooftop bar in the Gulch. Needless to say, it went well!
</Place>

<Place name="Cheekwood Botanical Gardens" location="Belle Meade">
  Rachel and Jack went to Cheekwood after dinner on their third date. They
  walked around the gardens, saw the Chihuly blown glass exhibit and fall
  decorations.
</Place>

<Place name="The Patterson House" location="Midtown">
  For Jack's 25th birthday, Jack introduced Rachel to The Patterson House. It's

  nights, and celebrated birthdays, anniversaries, and promotions.
</Place>

<Place name="The Catbird Seat" location="Midtown">
  For Rachel's 22nd Birthday, after a drink at The Patterson House, Jack
  surprised Rachel with a reservation at The Catbird Seat. Rachel and Jack had
  the best time, and have been back many times since! Some of their favorite
  more special dinners they attended include the Catbird Seat's 10th anniversary
  dinner, and Brian Baxter's collab with Pat Martin of Martin's Barbecue!

<Place name="Bourbon Steak" location="Downtown">

  Jack took Rachel for dinner after he proposed!)

<Place name="Tailgate Brewery" location="Midtown">

  Brewery's Mug Club. It's a favorite spot of theirs for a patio beer after
  work, or a Thursday night trivia game!

<Place name="Husk" location="Downtown">
  When Jack got promoted at work for the first time, Rachel took him to Husk to
  celebrate! Since then, they attended Husk's 10th anniversary dinner, and have
  been back many times for special occasions (or just because!), including
  brunch before they got engaged!
</Place>

<Place name="Yolan" location="Downtown">
  Rachel and Jack love a good tasting menu, and Yolan was no exception. After
  going to Il Luogo in Italy, and learning that the chef mentored Yolan's chef
  de cuisine, they had to try the menu stateside! It was phenomenal, like many
  of their experiences there. They also have attended wine tastings there, too!
</Place>

<Place name="Ryman Auditorium" location="Downtown">
  While Rachel and Jack have never seen a music show at the Ryman, they have
  seen two comedians there! They saw John Mulaney in 2022 just because, and
  Taylor Tomlinson in Fall of 2023 for Jack's birthday. They had a great time in
  the gorgeous space!
</Place>

<Place name="Maiz de la Vida" location="Gulch">
  Jack has been known to find really unique dates for the two of them. At Maiz
  de la Vida, they participated in a tortilla, salsa, and tamale making class.
  They learned everything from selecting and milling the corn, to recipes, and
  finishing the bites on a plate. They now go to their new restaurant in the
  Gulch all the time!
</Place>

<Place name="Cheekwood (again!)" location="Belle Meade">
  On October 26th 2024, after a brunch at Husk, Jack proposed to Rachel at
